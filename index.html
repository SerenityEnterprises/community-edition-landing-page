        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>
            Serenity's development was at its peak in the summer of 2016 - Now, it's more than a year later, and both developers
            now have other commitments. Serenity is costing more money to keep alive than it is making as a product. Furthermore, it feels
            disingenuous to keep selling Serenity as a product even though it is not receiving the attention it deserves, that is why
            we have decided to open-source the client, under the name <em>Serenity: Community Edition.</em>
        </p>

        <h2>Open-source</h2>
        <p>
            Since the client is now open-source, anyone is free to modify and distribute the client, provided they follow the terms of the license.
            This means that anyone has the power to improve and iterate on the existing Serenity codebase, including making hacks that keep bypassing
            as anticheats evolve, making the client perform better, and fixing bugs.
        </p>
